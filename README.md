**Welcome!**

In this project, I've made an attractive news homepage as part of a project from Frontend Mentor.

Here's what I've accomplished:

* I learned how to use CSS Grid for creating advanced layouts.
* I tried something new by using a design file that's different from what I'm used to in Figma. You can see the design I worked on by clicking [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl).
* I got better at placing elements exactly where they should be, using a picture as a guide.
* I got really good at making my website look almost exactly like the original, down to the smallest details.
